						Full of energy and good humour, I am a very dynamic person with a brand new project full of ambition. Now that the idea is defined, I have a few months left to plan it in detail and raise the money to finance it. Don't hesitate to participate in my online fund to help me to realize this beautiful project.

				<h2>Travel: a passion in my heart</h2>
				<p>
					I love to travel. I fell in love with the breathtaking landscapes, the encounters with people from all walks of life and the beautiful moments of sharing spent in the four corners of the world. Travelling is for me an intense moment of happiness.

				<h2>Cooking: a daily joy</h2>
				<p>
					Cooking is my passion. I love going to the market, choosing the best ingredients according to my desires to make delicious recipes full of flavour. I constantly strive to surpass myself and try to develop new recipes. My secret ingredient: love. When I cook, I do it to have a good time with my friends around a tasty meal.

				<h2>A project that combines my two interests</h2>
				<p>
					Recently, a project has been building up in my head, it has become obvious.  I have decided to travel through Europe in van with a friend. The aim of this travel would be to meet with chefs in each city we will visit, and then write a cooking book that explains the different culinary cultures of the countries we would have visited.
					You will have the opportunity to follw our adventure via my social medias.
